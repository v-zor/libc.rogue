libc.rogue
==========

small libc based on BSD libc. Ported to Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii.

includes at.rogue
=================

Ambienttalk/2 implementation in C here for embedded architectures,
based on libc.rogue addon code for new android platforms, as scheme48
(http://scheme48.org/) was ported to embedded systems.

Notes
=====

My ambienttalk/2 underground code with at.rogue for native Linux is at 
http://savannah.gnu.org/ which should eventually be parsed by the at.rogue 
virtual machine.
